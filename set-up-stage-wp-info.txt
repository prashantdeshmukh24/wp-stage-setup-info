                              how to set up wordpress into staging site manually
                              ================================================= 
Introduction:- 
Creating a staging site manually involves duplicating your existing WordPress site to a separate location where you can test changes, updates, or new designs without affecting your live site. Here are the steps to set up a staging site for WordPress:

Note: Before making any changes, it's a good practice to back up your website files and database.

1) Create a subdomain or subdirectory (optional but recommended):
   - Log in to your hosting account or cPanel.
   - Navigate to the "Subdomains" or "Addon Domains" section to create a subdomain like staging.yourwebsite.com or a subdirectory like yourwebsite.com/staging.

2)Copy Website Files:
   -Access your WordPress files via FTP (using software like FileZilla).
   -Duplicate your WordPress installation directory (usually named public_html or www) to the subdomain/subdirectory you created earlier.

3) Duplicate the Database:
   - Access your hosting control panel and find the phpMyAdmin tool (or a similar database management tool).
   - Locate your WordPress siteâ€™s database and export it to a file (usually in SQL format). You can do this by selecting the database, then clicking "Export."
   - Create a new database for your staging site via your hosting control panel.
   - Import the previously exported SQL file into this new database.

4)Update Site URLs in the Database:
   - After exporting your database, you may need to update URLs in the SQL file from http://yourwebsite.com to http://staging.yourwebsite.com or http://yourwebsite.com staging.
   - Open the SQL file in a text editor, perform a search and replace for your website URLs, and save the changes.

5)Update WordPress Configuration:
   - In your staging site's duplicated WordPress directory, locate the wp-config.php file.
   - Update the database details (database name, username, password) to match the new staging database you created earlier.
6)Login and Permalink Structure Update:
   - Access your staging site via the new URL (subdomain/subdirectory).
   - Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard using your credentials.
   - Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes" to update the permalink structure.
7) Check and Update Links & Images:
   - Browse through your staging site and ensure that all links, images, and functionalities work as expected.
8) Prevent Search Engine Indexing:
   - Install a plugin or use a robots.txt file to prevent search engines from indexing your staging site to avoid duplicate content issues.
9) Test Changes:
   - Perform any updates, changes, or tests on the staging site without affecting the live site.
